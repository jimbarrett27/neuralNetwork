# neuralNetwork

This is an implementation of an artificial neural network that I wrote a few months ago, as an attempt to understand them.

It is _not_ efficient nor particularly cleverly implemented, but I thought I'd commit it here for posterity. It also comes from a time when I was going a little bit class crazy, so sorry for that :)
